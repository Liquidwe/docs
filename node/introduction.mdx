## What is a Chainbase Network Node?

A Chainbase Network node is an operator running the Chainbase Network node software and playing an active role in the network. The nodes in the Chainbase Network are divided into two roles: Operator and Validator.

### 1. Operator

Operators play a crucial role in the network by providing the necessary computational resources for the execution layer, ensuring the smooth operation of data processing tasks. The Operator Node constructs the Eigenlayer AVS. As the Chainbase Network testnet phase prepares to launch, we will open up participation for Operators, inviting interested users to join.

### 2. Validator

Validators play a key role in maintaining the security and consensus of the network. They are responsible for ensuring data integrity and maintaining network stability. The Validator Node is constructed based on the Cosmos SDK, using the CometBFT and DPoS consensus mechanisms. As the Chainbase Network testnet phase prepares to launch, we will open up participation for Validators, inviting interested users to join.

## How to Participate as a Chainbase Network Node?

If you are interested in becoming an Operator or Validator for the Chainbase Network, please contact the Chainbase Network team for more information and guidance. We look forward to your participation in advancing the Chainbase Network.
